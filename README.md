# hu-gpt
We are attempting to use Open AI's existing GhatGpt to produce training, validation, and confimration data and serve as an agent in our custom RL optimizer for our custom gpt model. 

## Launch.R
The laucnh R script is the main script that all other resources are feed into and executed.


# Notes:

(1) Need to develop custom rl based optimizer using the chatgpt modle as aan agent using text prompt.
(2) Need to set up data pipeline to include a confirmation text for the rl agent optimizer to for its decisions.
